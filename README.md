# Effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Cybersecurity Threat Detection  

This repository contains the materials, analysis, and final report for my **Independent Scholarly Project (ISP)**, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the **Master of Information Technology** at the **Eastern Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand (2025)**.  
The project systematically evaluates the effectiveness of **Generative AI (GenAI)** including GANs, VAEs, and LLMs in strengthening cybersecurity threat detection.

## 📑 Abstract  

The rise of cyberattacks such as phishing, malware, and zero-day exploits creates serious risks for individuals, organizations, and governments. Traditional detection methods often struggle against these evolving threats. This project investigates the effectiveness of **Generative AI (GenAI)** in cybersecurity, focusing on three main applications:  

- **Synthetic data generation**  
- **Anomaly detection**  
- **Adversarial example generation**  

Findings from 48 peer-reviewed studies (2021–2025) show that GenAI-based detection systems **outperform traditional methods**, achieving higher accuracy, precision, and F1-scores while reducing false positives and negatives. Challenges remain in terms of adversarial vulnerabilities, computational demands, and ethical concerns.
